## Some Info

Your job: clean up the code as much as you can stand.

This is close to "real" code, i.e. it is the core of what's actually used in a production piece of working open source software. I made it just a touch worse by inlining a few free-standing function. It is what it is; please do not judge (it is not mine, either).

There are tests, I believe they are sufficient, but I could be wrong. (Maybe a code coverage run would tell more.)

The tests are a little lame. Feel free to clean up and add more.

You'll need to do an `npm install`.

To run tests, best bet is:

```
npm run test:watch
```
